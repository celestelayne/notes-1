##Rails Guides Reading

The [Rails Guides](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/) are the best resource for discovering more about Rails. Spend some time reading over them tonight.

> **Just read the section that is linked to** (i.e. section x.x); read beyond it, only if you have covered **all** the topics below.

>Chances are there will be things that don't stick immediately. The point of the reading is to **prime yourself** for these concepts. If you do it correctly, you **will absorb these concepts quicker** when they are reviewed again in class.
