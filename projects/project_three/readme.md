### Overview

**You’ve come a long way, and it's time to show it.** This will be your most advanced project to date, and it'll hopefully be the shining beacon of bragging rights for your portfolio as you make your way out into the world.

**You get to call the shots and invent your own idea**, choosing a framework & tools that's appropriate for what you want to build. Use everything you've learned so far, and **tackle something that'll push you a little outside of your comfort zone.**

Make sure it's **something you can accomplish in the limited time we have**, and make sure it's **something that'll be impressive visually**.

---

### Big Goals

* **Discover or invent an idea**, preferably one with some group of users that would jump at the chance to really use your product
* **Design a product _you_ want to build**, and choose appropriate technologies to build it
* **Pitch your idea to your instructors** and incorporate their feedback
* **Make productive use of your time**, and balance the responsibilities you have to so you can make sure it's a complete, impressive-looking project
* **Focus on writing solid, real-world code** that doesn’t repeat itself and is well-documented

---

### Technical Requirements

Your app must:

* **Use a database**, whether that's one we've covered in class or one you want to learn
* **Create a complete product**, which most likely means multiple relationships and CRUD functionality for each
* **Build a full-stack application** by making your own backend and your own front-end
* **Craft thoughtful user stories** that are significant enough to help you know which features to build and which to scrap
* Up your design & style game and **make a product that's impressive looking** to kick your portfolio up a notch
* **Deploy your application online** so it's publicly accessible


---

### Bonus

These are for extra credit! Don't focus on these until you've hit the core requirements.

* **Incorporate external APIs** to add data and functionality to your application
* **Use a visualization library** if there are any features that warrant beautiful data visualization
* **Use oAuth logins** to allow users to access data from other services
* **Build something you can really launch** and try to get real, actual users
* **Test** critical components of your code to ensure it works.

---

### Necessary Deliverables

* A **working full-stack application**, hosted somewhere on the internet
* A **link to your hosted working app** in the URL section of your Github repo
* A **git repository hosted on Github**, with a link to your hosted project, and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project
* **A ``readme.md`` file** with: 
    * Explanations of the **technologies** used
    * A couple paragraphs about the **general approach you took**
    * **Installation instructions** for any dependencies
    * Link to your **user stories** – who are your users, what do they want, and why?
    * Link to your **wireframes** – sketches of major views / interfaces in your application
    * Link to some **entity relationship diagrams** – model out your data relationships before coding
    * Link to your **pitch deck** – documentation of your wireframes, user stories, and proposed architecture
    * Descriptions of any **unsolved problems** or **major hurdles** overcome

### Suggested Ways to Get Started

* **Don’t get too caught up in awesome features** – simple is always better, and you can build something impressive that does one thing well.
* **Design first.** Planning with user stories & wireframes before writing code means you won't get distracted changing your mind – you'll know what to build, and you can spend your time wisely by just building it.
* **Don’t hesitate to write throwaway code** to solve short term problems.
* **Read the docs for whatever technologies / frameworks / API’s you use**.
* **Write your code DRY** and **build your APIs RESTful**.
* **Be consistent with your code style.** You're working in teams, but you're only making one app per team. Make sure it looks like a unified effort.
* **Commit early, commit often.** Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.
* **Keep user stories small and well-defined**, and remember – user stories focus on what a user needs, not what development tasks need accomplishing.
* **Write code another developer wouldn't have to ask you about**. Do your naming conventions make sense? Would another developer be able to look at your app and understand what everything is?
* **Make it all well-formatted.** Are you indenting, consistently? Can we find the start and end of every div, curly brace, etc?
* **Comment your code.** Will someone understand what is going on in each block or function? Even if it's obvious, explaining the what & why means someone else can pick it up and get it.
* **Write pseudocode before you write actual code.** Thinking through the logic of something helps.

### Project Feedback + Evaluation

* __Project Workflow__: Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program you’re in (detailed above)?

* __Technical Requirements__: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

* __Creativity__: Did you added a personal spin or creative element into your project submission? Did you deliver something of value to the end user (not just a login button and an index page)?

* __Code Quality__: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors as we have in class?

* __Problem Solving__: Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrated that you thought through alternative implementations? _(Note that this part of your feedback evaluation will take place during your one-on-one code review with your instructors, after you've completed the project.)_

* __Total__: Your instructors will give you a total score on your project between: 
    
    Score | Expectations
    ----- | ------------
    **0** | _Does not meet expectations._ 
    **1** | _Meets expectations, good job!_
    **2** | _Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!_
 
 This will serve as a helpful overall gauge of whether you met the project goals, but __the more important scores are the individual ones__ above, which can help you identify where to focus your efforts for the next project!
