# Vagabond App

## Brief

We have been commissioned to build a travel community, codenamed Vagabond for now, for users to share tips (aka posts) about their favorite locations around the world.

## Client Contract

The client has provided basic wireframes and user stories. In some cases, these requirements may be vague or incomplete.

* <a href="userstories.md" target="_blank">User Stories</a>

## Expectations

This contract consists of four core sprint and four bonus sprints. Each sprint consists of a set of user stories. YOU MAY NOT BEGIN A NEW SPRINT/BONUSES WITHOUT CLIENT APPROVAL.

You will work in groups of four, and we expect you to always **pair** when writing code.

During morning scrums and in smaller check-ins throughout the day, clearly communicate your current status and your next steps to your teammates. Use a kanban-style scrumb board such as trello to organize tasks (<a href="https://trello.com/b/JPdt327u/vagabond" target="_blank">example trello board</a>).

Commit changes at least once for each user story. Consider creating automated tests or even implementing **TDD** for any significantly complex application behavior.

Put effort into your **design**. Use a CSS framework (Bootstrap), partials, and some custom CSS or Sass/Less.

**Refactor** your code after each sprint, considering:

* Naming
* Commenting
* Organization
* DRYness
* Indentation
* Readability

## Questions to Ask Yourselves

1. **Are you all clear about what the client wants?** Identify vague areas. Seek clarification in any cases where you feel less confident about your interpretation of the client' vision.

1. **What will the UX/UI flow be?** Hammer out any areas of ambiguity in the wireframes

1. **Which models do need to be implemented?** Create an ERD for the client to reference.

1. **What are the major milestones or components that need to be completed?** How can these be turned into tasks that group members can complete in pairs? Where do these milestones overlap and how those related tasks be managed?

1. **What milestones are you and your group members interested in working on?** How can you effectively delegate the work into pairs so that each group member is interested, challenged, and productive?

## Presentation

Each group will present their project on **Friday, August 14th** starting at **9:17am**. Your group's presentation should be **5 minutes or less** and cover the following:

* Quick demo of your app (1 minute)
* Each group member should answer the following:
  * What parts of the project did you work on?
  * What did you learn about the process of working in a group?
